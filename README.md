# Gampepad API Demo

This app is an Next.js based implementation of the Browser Standard [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API) and is best viewed in a WebKit based browser.

It will work out of the box with most game controllers, with icons for PS4 and Switch Pro controllers.
